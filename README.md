Artificial intelligence teacher evaluating answer papers

Used Tesseract to extract the text in answer papers shown in front of google aiy vision kit.
We have a answer key with just keywords.
We scan the key and the answer paper and,based on the occurence of the key in the answer paper,the marks are given to the kids
Got some help from online sources on using tesseract and image cleaning process like skewing tilt image etc
